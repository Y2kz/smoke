Full Steam Ephemeral Key Exchange

Please note that this is a partial forward secrecy key exchange as
the generator of the ephemeral public-key pair records the pair in
an SQLite database. The ephemeral key-pair is removed from the database
after a response is received from the destination participant.

1. Generate an ephemeral public-key pair. A public-key pair is generated
   per file. Do not generate a public-key pair if one already exists or if
   private keys (4) have been recorded.
2. Locally record the ephemeral public-key pair.
3. Transfer ephemeral public key to destination participant.
4. Destination receives ephemeral public key and generates private keys.
   Do not generate private keys if private keys already exist.
5. Locally record private keys, unless private keys exist.
6. Destination encrypts private keys via the ephemeral public key and
   submits the results to the origin.
7. Origin receives bundle and deciphers the private keys via the
   ephemeral private key.
8. Origin records private keys.
9. Origin delete ephemeral public-key pair from local SQLite database.
