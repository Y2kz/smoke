53.    The initial call (1/2-1/2) should store the generated stream in a
       map (or hash).
       Upon receiving a timely response, the total key stream should be
       saved to smoke.db. If a timely response is not received, the partial data
       should be purged.
54.    Java serialization requires safety.
       (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/seccodeguide-139067.html#8)
55.    Inadvertent calling may sever an established session.
       Do not save a key stream unless a response is received.
       As the half-response does not produce a response, the automatic
       response's result is ignored.
56.    Organic half-and-half: resolve collisions. As Smoke is not ordered,
       order is impossible to predict.

       is problematic. If the current thread has been interrupted,
       exit run().
64.    Retain first-contact server certificate. Inspect stored
       bytes with received bytes.

       errors.

87.    EPKS description bubble.
88.    A release target for the make files.

       activity. Calls are not logged.
93.    Improve PBKDF2 uses. Initially, generate a temporary stream of
       20 bytes (SHA-1). Afterwards, generate a stream using the
       temporary stream as password material. The length of the second
       stream varies per application.
